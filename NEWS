0.3.1.20141226.0
----------------

### Deleted debian/* files from master branch, please see debian branch.

0.3.0.20141226.0
----------------

### Changed to use ./configure.

#### If you want to build Canna dictionary:

0) Prepare Canna's "mkbindic".
1) Type "./configure --with-canna".
2) Type "make".
3) You will get "yubin7.cbd" and "yubin7.cld".


#### If you want to build Wnn dictionary:

0) Prepare Wnn's "atod".
  NOTES:
  a) Some distributions do not have "atod" in FreeWnn package.
  b) The upstream version's FreeWnn installs atod to "/usr/local/bin/Wnn4".
    So you have to add "/usr/local/bin/Wnn4" to $PATH.
1) Type "./configure --with-wnn --without-canna".
2) Type "make".
3) You will get "yubin7.dic".


#### Please see "./configure --help".


### Removed binary dictionaries.

If you want binary,
please get RPM files from openSUSE Build Service.
http://software.opensuse.org/package/canna-yubin?search_term=canna-yubin

If you want deb file,
You should send RFP to Debian BTS.

Please read README.eucJP.
